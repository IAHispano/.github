We are a community-driven organization dedicated to promoting and advancing Artificial Intelligence. This is the official GitHub repository where we host our programming projects and contribute to the growth of the AI Hispano community.  

## Our Vision

At AI Hispano, we believe in the transformative power of AI to create positive change, but with that power comes responsibility. We are deeply committed to fostering responsible AI practices that prioritize inclusivity, fairness, and ethical considerations. This commitment is at the heart of everything we do, guiding how we build, collaborate, and engage with the broader AI community.
